description:
  PHP is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. More than 80% of websites on the Internet are written in this language.

  We'll learn PHP from scratch, starting from the very basics. The first module is a springboard for writing meaningful programs. In it, we'll show you how to write your first code in PHP. We'll tell you what comments are and why they're needed. We'll also look at testing by checking your solutions as an example.

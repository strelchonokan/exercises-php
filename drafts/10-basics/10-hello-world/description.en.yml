name: Hello, World!
theory: |
  As is our tradition, we'll begin by writing the 'Hello, World!' program. The program will print the following text:

  <pre class='hexlet-basics-output'>
  Hello, World!
  </pre>

  Output to the screen is done with a special command `echo`, followed by a single or double-quoted string to be output. Be sure to put a semicolon at the end.

  ```php
  <?php

  echo 'Hello, World!'; // => Hello, World!
  ```

  There are other ways to display a string on the screen. For example, you can use the function (a concept we will get to know later) `print_r()`. In this case, the string is entered in parentheses immediately after the function name. You also need to put `;` at the end.

  ```php
  <?php

  print_r('Hello, World!');
  ```

  In simple situations, there's no difference between these constructions. You can use either one method of output or the other. In more complex cases, where you want to display not just numbers or strings, but, for example, arrays, `echo` won't be able to do this, but `print_r()` will display everything.

instructions: |
  Copy the exact code from the instructions into the editor and run it by clicking «Run».

  ```php
  <?php

  print_r('Hello, World!');
  ```

  Note: If you write `heLLo, woRld!` instead of `Hello, World!`, it will be considered different text because upper and lower case letters are different characters. _Case is important!_ This rule affects almost everything in coding, so make sure you get used to paying close attention to the case at all times.

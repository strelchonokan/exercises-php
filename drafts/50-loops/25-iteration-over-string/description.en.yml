name: Traversing strings
theory: |

  You can use loops to process strings as well as numbers. Mainly as a way to retrieve a specific character by its index. Below is some sample code that prints the letters of each word on a different line:

  ```php
  <?php

  function printNameBySymbol($name)
  {
      $i = 0;
      // This check will be performed until the end of the string
      // including the last character. Its index is `line length - 1`.
      while ($i < strlen($name)) {
          // Getting a character by its index
          print_r("$name[$i]\n");
          $i = $i + 1;
      }
  }

  $name = 'Arya';
  printNameBySymbol($name);
  // => 'A'
  // => 'r'
  // => 'y'
  // => 'a'
  ```

  The main thing in this code is to set the right condition in `while`. This can be done in two ways: `$i < strlen($name)` or `$i <= strlen($name) - 1`. Both lead to the same result.

  Write a function, `printReversedWordBySymbol()`, which takes a word as input and prints it by character, just as in the example we gave, but does it in reverse order.

  ```php
  <?php

  $word = 'Hexlet';

  printReversedWordBySymbol($word);
  // => 't'
  // => 'e'
  // => 'l'
  // => 'x'
  // => 'e'
  // => 'H'
  ```

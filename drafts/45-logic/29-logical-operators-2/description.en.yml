name: Logical Operators 2
theory: |

  Logical operators are an important topic, so it's worth reinforcing them with some more examples and practice.

  Let's try to implement a function that checks a year to see if it's a leap year. A year is a leap year if it's a multiple of 400, or if it's both a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 100. As you can see, the definition already contains all the required logic, all we need to do is to put it into code:

  ```php
  <?php

  function isLeapYear($year)
  {
      return $year % 400 === 0 || ($year % 4 === 0 && $year % 100 !== 0);
  }

  isLeapYear(2018); // false
  isLeapYear(2017); // false
  isLeapYear(2016); // true
  ```

  Let's break it down piece by piece:

  - the first condition, `$year % 400 === 0`: means the remainder of division by 400 is 0, so the number is a multiple of 400
  - `||` **OR**
  - second condition `($year % 4 === 0 && $year % 100 !== 0)`
      - `year % 4 === 0`: means the remainder of division by 4 is 0, so the number is a multiple of 4
      - `&&` **AND**
      - `$year % 100 !== 0`: means the remainder of division by 100 is not 0, so the number is not a multiple of 100

instructions: |

  Write a function `isNeutralSoldier()`, that takes two arguments as input:

  1. Armor color (string). Possible variants: `red`, `yellow`, `black`.
  2. Shield color (string). Possible variants: `red`, `yellow`, `black`.

  The function returns `true` if *the color of the armor is not red and the color of the shield is black*. In other cases, it returns `false`.

  Call examples:

  ```php
  <?php

  isNeutralSoldier('yellow', 'black'); // true
  isNeutralSoldier('red', 'black');    // false
  isNeutralSoldier('red', 'red');      // false
  ```

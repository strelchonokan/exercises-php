name: mktime()
theory: |

  The [mktime()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mktime.php) function generates timestamp from time information: seconds, hours, minutes, and date.

  ```
  int mktime ([ int $hour = date("H") [, int $minute = date("i") [, int $second = date("s") [, int $month = date("n") [, int $day = date("j") [, int $year = date("Y") ]]]]]] )
  ```

  `mktime()` is a multi-word function, each part of the date and time is passed as a separate parameter.

  ```php
  <?php

  mktime(0, 0, 0, 7, 1, 2000); // 962409600
  ```

instructions: |

  Implement the `getHexletBirthday()`, function, which returns the founding date of the Hexlet as a timestamp. Hexlet was founded on 01/01/2012.

  ```php
  <?php

  getHexletBirthday();
  ```

name: Date
theory: |

  One of the main date functions in PHP is [date()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.date.php). It converts the timestamp to a human-readable format. The first parameter you need to pass to this function is the date format, which is arranged similarly to the formats for [sprintf()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.sprintf.php).

  ```php
  <?php

  // Y means year
  date('Y'); // 2018
  ```

  `date()` uses the current time by default. But if necessary, you can pass it a specific timestamp.

  ```php
  <?php

  date('M', 123123123); // Nov
  ```

  There are dozens of different formatting options in the `date()` function. They're all listed in detail on the documentation page. It's not at all necessary to memorize them all, but it's useful to understand the general principle of how it should work. All options can be combined with each other in any variation.

  ```php
  <?php

  date('l jS \of F Y h:i:s A'); // Thursday 26th of July 2018 10:58:55 AM
  ```

instructions: |

  Write an implementation of the `getCustomDate()` function that returns the date in the format `15/03/1985` based on the timestamp passed.

  Call examples:

  ```php
  <?php

  getCustomDate(1532435204); // 24/07/2018;
  getCustomDate(532435204);  // 15/11/1986;
  getCustomDate(5324352);    // 03/03/1970;
  ```

name: Strings
description:
  Text in programming is called “strings”, and strings aren't as simple as they seem. How do I output a phrase that has both single and double quotes? How do you deal with text in general, since the computer knows nothing about letters! The module focuses on various aspects of writing, from quotation marks and escaping to encodings.

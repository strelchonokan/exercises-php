name: Variable Parameter Functions
theory: |

  An interesting feature of some functions is that they can accept a varying number of arguments. We're not talking about default values. Check out this example:

  ```php
  <?php

  max(1, 10, 3); // 10
  ```

  The `max()` function finds the maximum value among the passed arguments. How many arguments do you think it expects to receive? This function's documentation shows something interesting:

    ```
    max ( mixed $value1 [, mixed $... ] ) : mixed
    ```

    This means that this function accepts any number of arguments as input (and can even be called without them). Passed arguments that are optional are shown with _[]_, which is the same as how optional parameters that have default values are described. The ability to pass any number of parameters is encoded with _[, ...]_.

    ```php
    <?php

    max(1, -3, 2, 3, 2); // 3
    ```

instructions: |

  Calculate the minimum number (in PHP) out of 3, 10, 22, -3, 0, and display it. Use the `min()` function, which works in the same way as `max()`.

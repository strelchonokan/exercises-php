  Do you remember the basic rule of arithmetic that changing the order of the numbers we're adding doesn't change the sum?  It's one of the most basic and intuitive rules of arithmetics, it's called the **commutative law**.

  A binary operation is considered commutative if you get the same result after swapping operands. Obviously, addition is a commutative operation:  _3 + 2 = 2 + 3_.

  But is subtraction a commutative operation? Of course not: _2 - 3 â‰  3 - 2_. In programming, this law applies in the same way as in arithmetic.

  Moreover, most of the operations we face in real life aren't commutative. In conclusion, you should always pay attention to the order of things you're working with.

  Write a program that counts and sequentially displays the values of the following mathematical expressions: "3 to the power of 5" and "-8 divided by -4".

  Note that the results will appear stuck together, on one line, and without any spaces. We'll learn how to deal with this problem in future lessons.

  - name: Commutativity
    description: |
      is the property of an operation wherein changing the order of operands doesn't affect the result. For example, addition is a commutative operation; changing the order of the numbers we're adding doesn't change the result.
